Could a collaborator object be shared between 
two different objects? What kinds of problems 
might this solve, and what kinds of problems 
could it introduce?

Yes, a collaborator object can be shared between 
two different objects. This can solve problems like 
reducing duplication and maintaining a single source
 of truth for shared data or behavior. However, 
 it could also introduce problems such as unintended 
 side effects if one object modifies the collaborator
in a way that affects the other object unexpectedly, 
leading to tight coupling and harder-to-track bugs.


Collaboration is a way of modeling relationships 
between different objects.

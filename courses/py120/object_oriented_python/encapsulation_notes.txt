What does "internal use" mean in this context?
 What purpose does a method designated for 
 internal use serve?



    "Internal use" means that an attribute or method is
    intended to be used only within the class itself 
    and not by code outside the class. It signals to 
    other developers that this part of the code is
    meant for the class's own internal workings 
    and not part of the public interface.


    A method designated for internal use serves to 
    encapsulate functionality that supports the class's 
    behavior but is not meant to be accessed or called 
    directly from outside the class. This helps keep 
    the external interface clean and prevents accidental 
    misuse or changes to those internal details.



Is there any way in Python to completely
 prevent a programmer from changing an object's
 internal state? If not, what's the point of using
  a single underscore to indicate internal use?

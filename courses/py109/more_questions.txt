Question 1 - Basic
What will the following code output? Explain your reasoning.
x = 10
y = x
x = 20
print(y)

the output of this question will print 10
this is because we assign y to the variable x
we then reassign the variable x but this assigns it to a new variable
y will continue to point to the original variable in memory for x


Question 2 - Intermediate
Examine the code below and explain what happens on each line. What will be the final output?
def modify_list(lst):
    lst.append(4)
    lst = [1, 2, 3]
    lst.append(5)
    return lst

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
result = modify_list(my_list)
print(my_list)
print(result)

this is an example of mutability, we are modifying the argument
in this code.
when we call result with the my_list we are appending 4 to the argument
we are then creating a new list on line 2
appending 5 to that list
and then returning it
what this results in is
when we print my_list the output will be [1,2,3,4]
but when we print result it will be [1,2,3,5]


Question 3 - Intermediate
What is the difference between the is operator and the == operator in Python?
Provide examples to illustrate your explanation.

the difference between is and == is that is checks to see if the values are equal as objects in memory
we could create two dictionaries with the same values, and they will not equal the same with is
where is == evaulates the truthiness of a value. if both objects were to be evaulated with == it would return true
where is would return false


Question 1 - Basic
What's wrong with this code and how would you fix it?
def greet_user(name):
    greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"
    return greeting

user_name = input("What's your name? ")
print(greet_user(user_name))



Question 2 - Intermediate
Identify the bug in this code and explain why it occurs:
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

grades = []
average = calculate_average(grades)
print(f"Average grade: {average}")

this is a divisible by zero issue. Because we are trying to divide
by 0 it will throw an error

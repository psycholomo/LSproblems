# JavaScript Modules Exercises

## 1. Basic
What are the main benefits of using modules in a JavaScript application?

## 2. Intermediate
Explain the purpose of `module.exports` and `require` in the context of CommonJS modules. Provide a simple code example with two files, `exporter.js` and `importer.js`, to demonstrate their usage.

## 3. Advanced
Create two files, `math.js` and `app.js`.

- In `math.js`, define and export an object that contains two functions: `add(a, b)` which returns the sum of two numbers, and `subtract(a, b)` which returns the difference.
- In `app.js`, import the `math` object using the CommonJS module system.
- Use the imported functions to log the result of `5 + 3` and `10 - 4` to the console.
